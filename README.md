# Digital_Skola_Final_Project
Machine Learning Model with Linear Regresion

Uber delivers service to lakhs of customers daily and it can be really important to manage their data properly to come up with new business ideas to get best results. Eventually, it becomes really important to estimate the fare prices accurately. And that's why we did this project, we're looking to predict the fare for world's largest taxi company Uber inc future transactional cases.

The source of our dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset

Here is the notebook where we did the data preprocessing and made the regression machine learning model :
